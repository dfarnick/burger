Start the Grill
This is a fun front-end and back-end application that allows users to add a burger to the page and devour it!

In order to get this application to work locally there are a few steps you will have to follow before hand.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory in your CLI.
3. Type the command "npm install" in order to bring in all the required packages.
4. Update the settings in confi/connection.js to match your MySQL username/pass/port.

You should be ready to start the server in the CLI. Enter "node server.js".
Open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000/ as the address.

How the grill works...
Enter the burger of your choice and click the Make A New Burger! button. This will place the burger of your choice in the Orders Up! window.

Click the Devour it!
